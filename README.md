# GNNEvaluationMetrics
The source code to reproduce results from master thesis study on comparison of GRAN and GraphRNN using new evaluation techniques by training a Graph Neural Network on a graph classification task. 

This is using the official PyTorch implementation of GIN [How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks ?](https://github.com/weihua916/powerful-gnns) as described in the following paper:
